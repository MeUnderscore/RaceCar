- This is a project to help me get better at c++ and AI algorithms. 
- The program uses SFML to create a race track and a car that can be driven. 
- The program then uses a NEAT algorithm to train a model to drive around the track as fast as possible. 
- The program is not done yet. I am still working on debugging the NEAT algorithm to improve its learning. 
- This program was written in Cursor with the help of its AI tools
